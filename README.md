# Colorful Spiral Project 🎨🐢🎶

Welcome to the **Colorful Spiral** project! This project demonstrates how to use Python's `turtle` graphics library to create an interactive colorful spiral and integrate background music using `pygame`.

## Description 📜

The **Colorful Spiral** project features a dynamic spiral drawing that changes colors over time using the HSV color space. The spiral is drawn by a turtle object 🐢 that continually changes its pen color as it moves. Additionally, the project includes background music 🎶 that plays during the spiral drawing, providing a more immersive experience.

Key features of the project:
- A colorful spiral 🌈 that changes colors over time.
- Music playback 🎧 using `pygame`.
- Press the "q" key to stop the program and music ⏹️.
- Uses Python's `turtle` 🐢 for graphics and `pygame` 🎮 for audio.
